# Vortex Ubuntu boot splash theme

![Vortex Ubuntu][vortex-ubuntu]

Animated [Plymouth][plymouth] theme with the Ubuntu logo and a futuristic and
elegant look.

The splash image color wheel spins at varying speeds creating a vortex effect.
During boot, a simple but elegant progress bar is displayed. Simultaneously, the
Ubuntu logo spins in the opposite direction.

Disk encryption password prompt is supported.

## Installation

To preview the theme interactively, install the `plymouth-x11` package:

```shell
sudo apt install plymouth-x11
```

To install the theme and set it as the default, navigate to the repository
directory and invoke the `install` script:

```shell
cd path/to/vortex-ubuntu-plymouth-theme
./install
```

`install` invokes `sudo` so you will be asked for your password.

## Preview / Testing

To preview the currently active Plymouth theme, navigate to the repository
directory and invoke the `test-plymouth` script:

```shell
cd path/to/vortex-ubuntu-plymouth-theme

# Show Plymouth preview for 10 seconds
./test-plymouth

# Show Plymouth with mock password and question/answer prompts,
# then show splash for 10 more seconds
./test-plymouth prompt
```

`test-plymouth` invokes `sudo` so you will be asked for your password.

## Removal

To remove the theme, navigate to the repository
directory and invoke the `install` script with the `uninstall` argument:

```shell
cd path/to/vortex-ubuntu-plymouth-theme
./install uninstall
```

`install` invokes `sudo` so you will be asked for your password.

The uninstallation process will prompt you to set a new theme. The default
Plymouth theme in Ubuntu 22.04 is `bgrt`.
